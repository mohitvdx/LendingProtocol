 # The Aave lending smart contract

Aave is a decentralized lending platform that allows users to lend and borrow cryptocurrencies. The core of Aave's functionality is implemented through smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain.

The main Aave lending smart contract handles:

- \/Depositing collateral from lenders
- Managing liquidity pools for each supported asset
- Calculating borrow limits for borrowers based on collateral
- Distributing interest payments to lenders from borrower fees
- Liquidating over-leveraged borrower positions

When a user deposits funds into Aave as collateral, the smart contract:

- Verifies the deposited asset
- Adds the funds to the corresponding liquidity pool
- Mints aTokens for the depositor representing their share of the pool

When a borrower takes out a loan, the smart contract:

- Verifies the borrower has sufficient collateral 
- Calculates the maximum loan amount (borrow limit)
- Transfers the borrowed funds to the borrower's wallet
- Tracks the borrower's debt

The smart contract also handles:

- Charging interest to borrowers
- Distributing interest payments to lenders and liquidity providers
- Liquidating under-collateralized borrower positions 

The Aave lending smart contract relies on sub-contracts to handle specific tasks:

- ReserveRateOracle: Provides the interest rates for each asset
- LendingPool: Handles depositing/withdrawing collateral and borrowing loans
- Liquidation: Handles liquidating over-leveraged borrower positions
- MintableERC20: Implements the aTokens that represent lender shares

This smart contract architecture allows Aave to efficiently manage lending pools for multiple assets and make loans according to preset conditions. By automating the lending process through smart contracts, Aave is able to offer an open and decentralized lending platform.
